<h1 align="center">Cycle Gothenburg</h1>

Cycle Gothenburg is a website for a fictional organisation that aims to build a community for long-distance cyclists in and around Gothenburg and to encourage more to take up cycling. The target audience for the website is people who are just starting out with long-distance cycling, those who are interested in getting started and for those who have more experience but are looking for a group of people to ride with. Through the website one can simply sign up to group rides and get a time, a place and a route for the ride.

- ## User Experience (UX)
An overall goal was to make the website work on a range of different devices.

  - ### 1. Goals for a First Time Visitor
    - a. For a first time visitor, it is important to get a grasp of what the website is about - easily and quickly.
    - b. For a first time visitor, it is important to be able to navigate the website easily.
    - c. For a first time visitor, it is important to easily find more information about the organisation.
    - d. For first time visitors, it is important to be able to contact the organisation with any questions about the concept.
    - e. For first time visitors, it is important that the sign up is easy to understand and to do.
  
  - ### 2. Goals for a Returning Visitor
    - a. For a returning visitor of the website, it is important that they can access the menu to navigate easily and quickly around the website, especially to the sign up-page.
    - b. For a returning visitor, it is important that they can contact the organisation easily with questions or feedback.

  - ### 3. Goals for a Frequent User
    - a. For a frequent visitor of the website, the most important thing is that the sign up is easy and quick.


- ## Features
  - ### Existing Features
    - **Navigation bar**
      - The navigation bar is set at the top right of the website on all pages which supports easy navigation. On smaller devices, such as mobile phones, this moves to a hamburger menu toggle bar.
      - The navigation bar is also marked for each page, for example, on the home page the navigation bar shows that you are currently on the "Home" page with a line underneath.
      - The logo on the top left corner of the website is also clickable and it leads you to the home page.

    - **Additional links to sign up**
      - On the Home page, the link to sign up is very prominent in the middle of the page. This link is also the main explanation of what the organisation does as it says "Join our cycling groups" and there is no other explanatory text on the home page.
      - On the page "About us" there is also a link embedded in the text that leads to the sign up page. The purpose of adding the additional links is to encourage the website visitor to sign up with easy access to the page for signing up.

    - **Sign up page**
      - The page to sign up contains a form where the person who would like to sign up fills out their basic information, their skill level in cycling and what level ride they would like to join.
      - There is also an informative text about how the sign up works.
      - The sign up page also shows three images with maps where examples routes are marked out, one for each difficulty level.
      ![Sign up page screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-tidemo/cycle-gothenburg/master/documentation/support-images/sign-up-page.png)
    - **Contact page**
      - The contact page includes a form for questions or feedback, a form to let the organisation know if you want to lead group rides, a map with the starting point of all rides and information such as email address and phone number to the organisation.
      ![Contact page screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-tidemo/cycle-gothenburg/master/documentation/support-images/contact-page.png)
    - **Footer**
      - The footer is the same on each page, which makes it easy to use, and features the organisation's social media accounts.

- ## Design
  - ### Colour scheme:
    ![Colour Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-tidemo/cycle-gothenburg/master/documentation/support-images/Colour-palette-cycling.png)
    A colour palette was created that reflected the video on the home page - reminiscent of the asfalt grey of roads and with a pop of colour which was inspired by the front figure's jacket.
  - ### Typography
    Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
    - Poppins is used for the headings and the paragraphs on the sites.
    - Lato is used for the footer.
  - ### Imagery
    The background-video and imagery were chosen to bring a bit of nature and calming colours of nature as this website is based around wellness and outdoor sports. The imagery was used as the foundation of the colour palette. All imagery is sourced from sites that don't infringe Copyright and I have credited these in the [credits](#Credits) section.
  - ### Wireframes

  - ### Accessibility
  For a user experience that works for everyone, I have done the following to make sure that the website is as accesible as possible:
   - Used semantic HTML
   - Used contrasting colours throughout the website.
   - Used descriptive alt attributes on images.
   - Provided information for screen readers where there are icons and no text, such as the logo.
   - Ensured that the menus are accessible by marking the current page as the current for screen readers.

- ## Technologies Used
  - ### Language Used
    The languages used for this website are HTML and CSS.

  - ### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used
    [Balsamiq:](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes

    [Uxwing:](https://uxwing.com/) was used to add icons.
    
    [Pexels:](https://www.pexels.com/sv-se/) was used to find images and videos for the styling of the webpage.

    [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to import the 'Poppins' and 'Lato' fonts into the style.css file which are used on all pages of the project.

    [Git:](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control by utilising the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

    [GitHub:](https://github.com/) is used as the respository for the projects code after being pushed from Git.

- ## Deployment
    The website was deployed using github and the following instructions:
    
    1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab, then choose Pages from the left hand menu

    2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch

    3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment

    4. Any changes pushed to the master branch will take effect on the live project

    I have continuously used git as my local repository and github as my online repository. To do this, I have created a git repository and then, with any changes I have sent git commits to my local repository and then, by using git push, sent it to my github repository.

    The live website can be found here: [Cycle Gothenburg](https://e-tidemo.github.io/cycle-gothenburg/)

- ## Testing
    Testing was done throughout the project, not least with Chrome developer tools which I used to troubleshoot issues that would arise while building the website and to test the responsiveness of the website on different devices.

    I also tested the website in Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox.

    - ### Validator Testing
    [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

    All pages of the website were tested in the HTML validator with the following results:

    - ### Lighthouse Testing
    

    - ### Known Bugs
    There was one bug I didn't manage to fix and it is that the dropdown menu on smaller devices covers the Cycle Gothenburg headline. I would have like to have it appear below the headline but I was unable to find a solution to this issue.

- ## Credits
  - ### Code Used
  I used a combination of code from three different sources to create a video background that was responsive for different screen sizes:
    - Code on how to make a video background in HTML and CSS [How To Add Video Background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znqUwx0b0HI)
    - Code on how to make a video background in HTML and CSS with a mobile first mindset [Mobile First Video Background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDwf7dIvGNQ)
    - Further code on how to make a website with a video background responsive [How to Make a Responsive Website with a video background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzdkx3Mk9Bk)
  I also used the following code to build a hamburger menu that appears on smaller screens/devices:
