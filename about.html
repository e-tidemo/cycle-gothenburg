                <p>Do you miss someone to go on those amazing, long bike rides with? Not anymore!
                    That is why Cycle Gothenburg exists. We are building a community of cyclists in and around Gothenburg
                    to share this wonderful hobby and passion for life on two very thin wheels.
    
                    We set routes that are adjusted for different levels of experience or different goals.
                    Sometimes we just want a chill ride, maybe even with a caf√© stop along the road,
                    then our leisure rides are for you! If you are looking for more of a challenge but 
                    you haven't been doing this for very long, maybe join our intermediate rides?
                    Or, if you really want to get out there and go far and fast, sign up for the hard level rides.
                    You can also choose from week to week what you most fancy.
    
                    The most important thing is that you don't need to do all the planning, all you have to do
                    is <a href="form.html" aria-label="link to sign up-page">sign up</a> and join us on the next ride!
